# BudgetBuddy
This is a mobile application done for android devices which was completed with four other group members. The user is prompted with a questionnaire geared towards the type of individual the user is. There is a budget-management system that includes individual spending and a summary of spending. You are able to manipulate spending data and support for multiple accounts.
